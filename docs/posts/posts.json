It is believed that we have an innate connection to certain places, this is defined as topophilia and has been studied for many years (Tuan 1990). Places, particularly natural ones, are known to have restorative psychological effects when visited (Ratcliffe and Korpela 2018; Scannell and Gifford 2017; Ulrich 1981). It is thought that people imbue environments with meaning arising from their current needs and wellbeing (Kerr and Tacon 1999). Favourite or meaningful places have been studied as a way of environmental self-regulation, a coping mechanism to enhance subjective wellbeing and promote emotional regulation (K. Korpela 1992; K. M. Korpela et al. 2010).\r\nThese ideas have been taken a step further by looking at illicit emotional responses in the brain in reaction to meaningful places, providing evidence that meaningful places are unique as our brains process images of them differently to other places (Gatersleben et al. 2020; Lengen and Kistemann 2012). With places becoming restricted or forbidden during COVID-19, it is an important time to measure how our use of meaningful places might be affecting our wellbeing. Findings of quality of life decreasing during COVID-19 if no emotion regulation was occurring (Panayiotou, Panteli, and Leonidou 2021) furthers this point. Emotion dysregulation has also been found to predict greater acute COVID-19 stress and is a vulnerability factor to poor stress responses (Tyra et al. 2021).\r\nLife satisfaction and happiness are frequently studied together worldwide. The two terms have been used under the heading of subjective wellbeing (Selim 2008) and hedonic wellbeing (Di Fabio and Palazzeschi 2015; Kahneman, Diener, and Schwarz 1999). Studies include measures of cultural variation, (Bastian et al. 2014) in relation to suicide rates (Bray and Gunnell 2006), in relation to physical health in elderly populations (Lara et al. 2020), in relation to wellbeing trends as populations age (An et al. 2020), and more recently in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (Bozkurt and Aytaç 2021). Happiness in particular is rated as an important characteristic for subjective wellbeing, with college students in one study rating it on average 8.1 out of 9 for importance, compared to other wellbeing characteristics (Kim-Prieto et al. 2005).\r\nThe current study looks at life satisfaction and happiness scores in relation to the importance or motivation to visit a meaningful place. Importance is split up into three subcategories: happy, sad, and reflective reasons to visit a place. The question is if motivations to visit a meaningful place predict subjective wellbeing. Hypotheses include (1) the motivation to visit a meaningful place in a positive mood will relate to higher subjective wellbeing scores. Conversely, the motivation to visit for a negative reason will relate to lower overall subjective wellbeing. (2) Consistent with K. Korpela et al. (2020), life satisfaction will be positively associated with sad and happy motivations to visit a place, but not reflective motivations.\r\nMethod\r\nParticipants (n = 303) were recruited through an undergraduate introduction to psychology course at Victoria University, Wellington, New Zealand. Participants were awarded course credit for taking part in the study. The mean age of participants was 19.45 (SD = 4.46) with an age range of 17-69. One outlier was removed from the data set for having an age over 1000. 80.8% of participants identified as female (n = 245), 15.5% male (n = 47), and 3.1% non-binary (n = 3). 8 participants did not supply a gender identification.\r\nProcedure. Participants took part in the survey online through Qualtrics. The survey was broken into two sections. Part one contained the upload of a meaningful image to the participant. This was followed by open-field questions to determine the meaning of the place and two scales to determine the places importance and situational meaning. The second part of the survey included self-measures for nature connectedness and a variety of wellbeing measures. The survey took approximately 30 minutes to complete, and participants could withdraw at any time. Only the three scales described below will be used in the current report. For our analysis we used R [Version 4.0.4; R Core Team (2021)]1,\r\nMaterials\r\nHappiness was measured by the measure of subjective happiness scale (Lyubomirsky and Lepper 1999). This scale consists of 4 items that are rated between 1 and 7. Values of the scale differed for each question. The following statement was provided before commencement “For each of the following statements and/or questions, please select the point on the scale that you feel is most appropriate in describing you.” A mean happiness score for each participant was calculated by summing all items. The full scale can be found in the appendix ??\r\nLife Satisfaction was assessed using the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) (Diener et al. 1985). Participants responded to a likert 7-point scale. The items were preceded by the statement: “Below are five statements that you may agree or disagree with. Using the 1 – 7 scale below indicate your agreement with each item. Please be open and honest in your responding.” The scale ranged from 1(strongly disagree) to 7(strongly agree). A mean life satisfaction score for each participant was created by summing all items. The full scale can be found in the appendix ??\r\nMotivations to visit a place. An amended version of the importance of places scale (K. Korpela et al. 2020) was administered to participants to assess the reasons that place was visited. Participants responded on a likert 7-point scale which ranged from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very important). Due to initial confirmatory factor analysis results from K. Korpela et al. (2020), we amended the scale from 19 items down to 13. We then added the item “when wanting to meditate” to the alone or reflective category. The final 14-item scale was prefaced with the statement: “How important are the following situations as reasons to visit the place in the photo?” These reasons create three subfactors: Happy or well (4-items), alone or reflective (3-items), and sad or depressed (7-items) motivations. Items were grouped into the above categories and a sum score was calculated for each category. The full scale can be found in the appendix ??\r\nScale Statistics\r\nThe spread of responses to each scale are shown in fig 1. This allows us to check if scale distribution is normal to fit the assumptions of the structural equation model.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Distribution of scales in present study\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main descriptive statistics for each scale can be found in table 1. Multiple reliability tests were run to determine the scales alpha, omega and coefficient H. This is because the alpha reliability alone assumes scales are uni-dimensional and normally distributed. Items in each motivations to visit a place subscale were not shown to be normally distributed in fig 1 above.  \r\nTable 1\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1: Descriptive statistics and reliabilities of present study scales, N = 302\r\n\r\n\r\nScale\r\n\r\n\r\nMean(SD)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlpha\r\n\r\n\r\nOmega\r\n\r\n\r\nCoefficient_H\r\n\r\n\r\nSHS\r\n\r\n\r\n4.27 (0.76)\r\n\r\n\r\n0.87\r\n\r\n\r\n0.89\r\n\r\n\r\n0.88\r\n\r\n\r\nSWLS\r\n\r\n\r\n4.49 (1.27)\r\n\r\n\r\n0.84\r\n\r\n\r\n0.88\r\n\r\n\r\n0.87\r\n\r\n\r\nMotHap\r\n\r\n\r\n5.13 (1.56)\r\n\r\n\r\n0.90\r\n\r\n\r\n0.92\r\n\r\n\r\n0.94\r\n\r\n\r\nMotSad\r\n\r\n\r\n4.04 (1.69)\r\n\r\n\r\n0.94\r\n\r\n\r\n0.96\r\n\r\n\r\n0.95\r\n\r\n\r\nMotRef\r\n\r\n\r\n4.73 (1.82)\r\n\r\n\r\n0.82\r\n\r\n\r\n0.83\r\n\r\n\r\n0.85\r\n\r\n\r\nNote.  SHS = Subjective Happiness Scale; SWLS = Satisfaction with Life Sacle; MotHap = Happy Motivation Subscale; MotSad = Sad Motivation Subscale; Motref = Refletive Motivation Subscale.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe initial use of the motivations to visit a place scale had comparable reliability, with cronbach’s alpha being reported as 0.93 for sad motivation, 0.87 for happy motivation and 0.8 for alone motivation subscales (K. Korpela et al. 2020).  \r\nNetworks\r\nA network graph, shown in fig 2 is used to display the connectedness of the scales used in the current study. As expected, life satisfaction and happiness form a connection. The three subscales of motivations to visit a place form a strong connection.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Network graph of the current studies scales\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exploratory graph analysis (EGA) in fig 3 shows that life satisfaction and happiness are still separate constructs, but that the three subscales of motivations to visit a place may be measuring only one construct. To ensure the new motivations to visit a place subscales were measuring three separate constructs, a second exploratory graph analysis was run (see appendix 6). This shows that the subscales are connected, yet independent constructs. A network graph was also run for the new subscales to ensure that items selected to mean happy, sad, and reflective are most connected to those selected constructs. This was found to be accurate (see appendix 7).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: EGA graph of current studies scales showing three seperate constructs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrelation Analysis\r\nFig 4 depicts correlations between scales. All correlations are run with Holm adjustment, this reduces the possiblilty of a statistically significant result, or type 1 error when performing multiple tests. This correction is more statistically powerful than a Bonferroni adjustment\r\n(ADD CITE ONCE SYNCHED).\r\nLife satisfaction and happiness correlate significantly. All three motivations for visiting a place correlate significantly, with reflective and sad being the strongest. These results are comparable with those of K. Korpela et al. (2020) that found sad and reflective to correlate at 0.68, sad and happy to correlate at 0.32, and reflective and happy to correlate 0.35.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Correlation plot of scales in current study\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nModel Selection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Conceptual structural equation model of the present study. mts = sad motivation subscale; mth = happy motivation subscale; mtr = reflective motivation subscale; swl = satisfaction with life scale; shs = subjective happiness scale\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA structural equation model (SEM) (fig 5) is run in this study to analyse motivations to visit a meaningful place against life satisfaction and happiness. The maximum likelihood estimation (ML) is employed, which presumes multivariate normality of the variables. As stated previously, and depicted in fig 1, the motivations to visit a place subscales were not normally distributed, so a bootstrap adjustment was fitted to the model. This runs the same analysis 1,000 times to get an average which creates more reliable and robust results, particularly when considering non-normality. \r\nResults\r\nThe structural equation model (SEM) is fully saturated (CFI = 1). Therefore, a second model to determine if model fit differs by gender is run. Regression paths are identical between groups (CFI = 1 for both), which implies that gender does not impact the model. This allows the model to be confidently collapsed together.\r\nThe main model is depicted in table 2 and shows that only happy motivations to visit and happiness scores were significant (B = 0.139, p=0.010). However, happy motivation and life satisfaction scores were near significance (B = 0.104, p=0.070), this is likely due to the correlation between happiness and life satisfaction. Reflective motivations to visit a place on subjective wellbeing were non-significant but positive (B = 0.033 - 0.043), whereas sad motivations for visiting a meaningful place on subjective wellbeing were non-significant and negative (B = -0.065 - -0.067). A model depiction of the results can be found in appendix 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 2: \r\n\r\n\r\nStructural equation model results, N = 302\r\n\r\nOutcome\r\nPredictor\r\nB\r\np\r\nswls\r\nmotsad\r\n-0.067[-0.188, 0.052]\r\n0.27\r\nswls\r\nmothap\r\n0.104[-0.008, 0.221]\r\n0.07\r\nswls\r\nmotref\r\n0.043[-0.067, 0.159]\r\n0.45\r\nshs\r\nmotsad\r\n-0.065[-0.198, 0.057]\r\n0.30\r\nshs\r\nmothap\r\n0.139[0.035, 0.246]\r\n0.01\r\nshs\r\nmotref\r\n0.033[-0.088, 0.143]\r\n0.56\r\n\r\nNote. swls = life satisfaction scale; shs = happiness scale; motsad = sad motivation subscale; mothap = happy motivation subscale; motref = reflective motivation subscale\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nThe aim of the current study was to see if motivations to visit a meaningful place could predict subjective wellbeing. I found partial support for the first hypothesis, that the motivation to visit a meaningful place in a positive mood does relate to higher subjective wellbeing scores. This was supported by positive and statistically significant paths between subjective happiness scores and happy motivations to visit a meaningful place. There was also some support for the converse of this, with sad motivations to visit a meaningful place having negative paths to both subjective wellbeing measures, however these were not significant.\r\nSupport was not found for hypothesis two, as life satisfaction was positively associated with happy and reflective reasons, and negatively with sad reasons. None of these paths were significant. This does not support K. Korpela et al. (2020) study.\r\nImplications\r\nFindings from the current study can be extrapolated to wider research in emotion regulation and place attachment…. Inferences can be made that it seems to be about knowing what makes you happy, or going to meaningful place for a happy reason, not a sad or reflective one that has an impact on your subjective wellbeing.\r\nThis does support the notion that we have an attachment to places and that they can influence our wellbeing, which supports the topophilia hypothesis (CITE).\r\nLimitations and Future Research\r\nThis research is reliant on participants identification of a meaningful place. As a university sample was used to collect data, there is a fear that answers may not have been accurate, and that there may have been participant response bias (CITE).   ALSO SELF REPORT BIAS.\r\nA study of 17-to-25 year olds found that wellbeing varies significantly with age and gender López-Madrigal et al. (2021). This may create another limitation of the current study, particularly as the SEM was run on different genders.  \r\nFinally, the current study includes a scale that has not been widely tested on different populations and age groups. It was initially created for the public of Finland and Hungary and has now been tested on an undergraduate population of New Zealand. The results of this study do not reflect wider cultural or age demographics and should be interpreted with caution if generalising across these areas.   \r\nFuture research could test the scale with different populations and age ranges to improve its scope and generalisability. The ideas of meaningful places should also be tested more empirically (rather than self-report scales) in the future, with open text data or neuroimaging when visiting meaningful places, or stress responses for example. Further quantification of meaningful places and what they mean to and for us and measuring more than one place and more than two levels of subjective wellbeing should also be explored.\r\nAppendix\r\nItems are grouped into the following three categories and then sum scored within their category. Happy or well (items 8-11), Alone or reflective (items 12-14), Sad or depressed (items 1-7).\r\nThe exploratory graph analysis (EGA) in appendix 6 presents items from the motivations to visit a place scale as three separate constructs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: EGA of itema in motivations to visit place subscales in the current study showing three seperate constructs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe network distribution graph in appendix 7 shows the item correlations of the reasons to visit a place scale. The purpose of this was to see if there were three main groups found to allow for three sub-scales to be created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Network Graph of items in the motivations to visit places subscales in the current study\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results to the structural equation path mode are also depicted in fig 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8: Structural equation path model of current study. Note. positive paths are green, negative are red. All values reported are the unstandardised beta. The only paths with significance in this model are between swl and shs and shs and mothap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubjective Happiness Scale\r\nFor each of the following statements and/or questions, please select the point on the scale that you feel is most appropriate in describing you.\r\nIn general, I consider myself: 1 (not a very happy person) to 7 (a very happy person)\r\nCompared with most of my peers, I consider myself: 1 (less happy) to 7 (more happy)\r\nSome people are generally very happy. They enjoy life regardless of what is going on, getting the most out of everything. To what extent does this characterization describe you? 1 (not at all) to 7 (a great deal)\r\nSome people are generally not very happy. Although they are not depressed, they never seem as happy as they might be.

    "contents": "\r\nWeek 10 Workbook\r\nUsing the nzl dataset or another dataset of your choice, write a varying intercept/varying slope model.\r\nThe variables I have identified to answer this question are Personal Relationships and Agreeableness. This is due to the potential association between the variables over the years (waves). I hypothesize that as agreeableness increase, personal relationships should also increase. I expect these variables to change slightly over years as people develop and grow.\r\nBrief Methods\r\nThe data for this short report is taken from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values over time dataset (NZAVS). This dataset includes 2845 individuals that have responded on at least five different years to both personal relationship and agreeableness questions.\r\nWe fit the variables to a varying slope model to try and determine if the relationship between agreeableness and personal relationships changes over time. Each slope represents a different wave of the data (or different year that data was collected).\r\nFinally, we fit the model to a conditional effects graph to check that the two variables do indeed associate with each other in some way.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nAGREEABLENESS\r\n\r\n\r\nPredictors\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimates\r\n\r\n\r\nCI (95%)\r\n\r\n\r\nIntercept\r\n\r\n\r\n4.82\r\n\r\n\r\n4.76 – 4.87\r\n\r\n\r\nYour.Personal.Relationships\r\n\r\n\r\n0.07\r\n\r\n\r\n0.06 – 0.08\r\n\r\n\r\nRandom Effects\r\n\r\n\r\nσ2\r\n\r\n0.89\r\n\r\n\r\nτ00Wave\r\n\r\n0.00\r\n\r\n\r\nτ11Wave.Your.Personal.Relationships\r\n\r\n0.00\r\n\r\n\r\nρ01\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nρ01\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nICC\r\n\r\n\r\n0.00\r\n\r\n\r\nN Wave\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n\r\nObservations\r\n\r\n\r\n22067\r\n\r\n\r\nMarginal R2 / Conditional R2\r\n\r\n0.023 / 0.023\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above model does not appear to fit the model perfectly, so we then attempted to remove the random slope to see if we could generate a model that fits data better. The below model and graph is the result:\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nAGREEABLENESS\r\n\r\n\r\nPredictors\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimates\r\n\r\n\r\nCI (95%)\r\n\r\n\r\nIntercept\r\n\r\n\r\n4.82\r\n\r\n\r\n4.77 – 4.87\r\n\r\n\r\nYour.Personal.Relationships\r\n\r\n\r\n0.07\r\n\r\n\r\n0.06 – 0.07\r\n\r\n\r\nRandom Effects\r\n\r\n\r\nσ2\r\n\r\n0.89\r\n\r\n\r\nτ00Wave\r\n\r\n0.00\r\n\r\n\r\nICC\r\n\r\n\r\n0.00\r\n\r\n\r\nN Wave\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n\r\nObservations\r\n\r\n\r\n22067\r\n\r\n\r\nMarginal R2 / Conditional R2\r\n\r\n0.023 / 0.023\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nBoth models above do not appear to fit the data particularly well and we can interpret that the models explanatory power is weak (R2 = 0.02, 89% CI [0.02, 0.03], adj. R2 = 0.02).\r\nFrom the conditional effects graph above, however, we can see that there may be a relationship between the two variables as this graph shows that as personal relationships increase, so do does agreeableness ratings or scores. Perhaps this relationship is simply consistent over time, which is why no large difference was found over the years in the varying slope models.\r\nThe other limitation of the models fit could be due to the dataset containing the same individuals over several years. Perhaps with different populations, ethnicities and/or countries measures there may be a more varying degree in the way these two variables associate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
