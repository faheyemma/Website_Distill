I am currently based in the windy capital of New Zealand, Wellington.
I am a governmental advisor and love to talk about Harry Potter, FPL or anything not related to R coding! \  
Here are some key quotes from our resident R instructor: 


*1. Always think with your mind.*

*2. Let's do some mind thinking.* 

*3. Stop thinking.*
